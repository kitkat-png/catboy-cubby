                <p>Hey, how's it going! This is my very first post on this site. I'm not sure when this site is actually gonna go up to be honest. I think I still have a good amount of work to do.</p>

                <p>I think the two main things I'm gonna be using this blog for is talking about how I'm doing with my current goals and little thoughts about how it's like to live inside my mind. I'm hoping that I'll be able to look at this blog years from now and understand parts of my former mindset.</p>

                <p>Right now this site is pretty minimalistic but I'm hoping to add more art and decorations in the future.</p>

                <p>I've decided to have the goal to start trying to have more fun. Sure, lots of things are stressful right now, but it's easier to cope with things when you have ways to have fun.</p>

                <p>I wanna get back in touch with my roots and do some of the stuff I liked to do when I was younger. For example, when I was a kid I liked writing stories in more of a 'stream of consciousness' way so I'm trying to incorporate more of that into my current writing style.</p>

                <p>Also, it's funny how lots of the things I wanna get for myself once I have money are kids things. Like, I swear once I live alone it's probably gonna look like a kid lives there even if it's just me.</p>

                <p>And you know what? I'm not ashamed of that. I like having fun! I don't care what the people who hate fun think.</p>

                <p>Recently I figured out something new about my gender stuff! Turns out I'm not bigender but mostly a guy, I'm bigender as in both a guy and a girl. I'm both boyflux and girlflux which means my feelings of being a guy and a girl both fluctuate!</p>

                <p>I'm really excited about this because this realization really explains a lot and it's one more step towards expressing my true self more! Like, turns out I experience gender dysphoria being called a girl because when people call me that they're usually not recognizing my masculine gender at all and they're seeing me as just a girl. I also experience a bit of gender dysphoria being called a guy too when I know people are seeing me as just a guy. I used to not understand why I'd experience dysphoria being called a guy but now I fully get that, yeah, that's really not the whole picture!</p>

                <p>I hope everyone has a lovely day today by the way!</p>
