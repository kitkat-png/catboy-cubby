            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <img id="pastel-rainbow" src="images/pastel-rainbow.png" alt="">

            <p>Hello, here's a personal website made by a creature who really loves their computer and their cats and tons of other stuff. I'm mainly making this website because I was banned from Facebook and want somewhere to yap where people will (hopefully) see!</p>

            <p>Features I'm planning on having on this site:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For this site to be as accessible as I can make it.</li>
                <li>Cute little drawings.</li>
                <li>For the site to fit my personal style.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>There are certain things like light/dark modes that are things I'd love to add, but it isn't really a priority for me. As of now basic accessability features like alt text on pictures and things being pretty are my main priorities.</p>
